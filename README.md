# CNN_basic
Code for deep learning learner

This is a set of codes realizing convolutional neural network (CNN). The idea of their implementation is: initialize tensors and repeat to create your own data set; Create your own model; Initialize the optimizer and train your model. You can modify the code yourself to see your training results.

Through this project, you can learn how to build your own CNN model and train this model with your data set.

I'll be glad if these codes are helpful to you.
